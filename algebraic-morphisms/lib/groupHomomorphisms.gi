# Displays the preimages of all the subgroups of the quotient isomorphic to a given group.
# INPUT:
# > G - a finite group which is the domain of the quotient map
# > N - a normal subgroup of G with respect to we take the quotient G/N
# > H - a group which is supposed to be isomorphic to a subgroup of G/N
# OUTPUT:
# > displays the preimages grouped in the corresponding conjugacy classes of subgroups of G
